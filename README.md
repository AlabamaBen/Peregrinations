# Peregrinations

Important : This is a gamejam game, I didn't came back to it after, the code is very messy, sorry for that.

Peregrinations - Fly as far as you can is an absurd humoristic game where the goal is, obvsiously to fly as far as you can, in your baloon. I'm not going to spoil your fun so I'm not going to say too much, besides, you can grab and throw stuff, feel free to experiment :)
Disclaimer : UI might be broken depending on your screen's resolution.

The team : this is our first "official" game jam. We're both beginners, Benjouille, the developer is just starting out with Unity, and Mathilde, the graphist, has just started learning 3D modeling for video games ( on maya )
